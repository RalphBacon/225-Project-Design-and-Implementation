# 225 Project Design and Implementation
How I design a project from schematic, through PCB and getting the parts for final construction

#### JLCPCB $2 for 5 boards, any colour including **purple**, and Aluminium! https://www.jlcpcb.com/cgh  

So you're an Arduino project maker noob? Feeling a bit overwhelmed by it all? Where to start? What could possibly go wrong?

I describe what I do to maximise project success, from the schematic (circuit diagram), the PCB and obtaining all the parts, using my Smart Heater Contoller that I'm building for my workshop as an example.

### PARTS I'M USING (UK sourced, mainly, but available worldwide)
► 20mm Glass Fuse holder (240v 1A)

► XE1201 snubber (and datasheet)
